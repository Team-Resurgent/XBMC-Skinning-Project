VISOR for XBox Media Center 1.1 
-------------------------------

Requirements:
XBMC 1.1 (CVS > 25-09)


This is my last update of Visor. 

All graphics are unpacked in the "media"-folder, you can change anything you want.

I would be glad if i could see future updates of Visor from YOU - its really funny and you can learn many things - and you can publish your update of visor or any changes on www.xbox-skins.net or www.allxboxskins.com - all credits will go then, of course, to YOU.


Have fun playing around with xbmc and hopefully with Visor! 

greetings,

From VISOR for XBox Media Center 1.0


This is my little contribution to the amazing Xbox Media Center.

The skin is a port of Visor, a skin for myth-tv (www.mythtv.org), and is based on the great default XBOX MediaCenter-Skin.

Some graphics and ideas are taken from the excellent skins BlackBlue, Project Mayhem and HiFi.

 
Credits therefore go to 

- just1nux and Ben Levitt (original visor-skin -> www.mythtv.org)

- Shadow_Mx (MediaCenter Skin) 
- Wabid Woveren (MediaCenter skin) 
- Chokemaniac (Project Mayhem)
- Leonardo (BlackBlue)
- Onkel Bouncy (HiFi)



Thanks to the XBMC-Team for a great program.
