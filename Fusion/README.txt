Fusion for XBMC

"Its all about the media!"

Fusion is a new skin for the Xbox Media Center.  The skin is designed to put the media in the spotlight, and makes the actual UI as minimal and unobtrusive as possible.  Controls that you need to use infrequently are hidden away and only come into view as needed.

Fusion is designed, created, and coded by Agathorn, and is inspired and influenced by the Xephyr/Aeon, and Fluid skins.

Initial ALPHA Release
---------------------
This is the initial release of the skin.  At this point, very little is done and there are no doubt some bugs to be worked out in what has been done.  This skin was made first and foremost for my own personal use.  99% of what I do with XBMC is TV and Movies, so that was the initial focus of the skin.

Currently skinned:
Home screen
Video Library, for TV Shows and Movies
NTSC, PAL, and 720p only

Useage Guidelines
-----------------
To access the menu in the Video Library, simply navigate to the left.

The video library is designed to be used with certain view types in certain places.  If you toggle through the various views, you will find ones designed for TITLES (TV Show Titles), SEASONS, and EPISODES.  Each is designed to be used at the appropriate level when viewing TV Shows.  There are also three Movie (one in 720p) views called MOVIES, MOVIES 2 and MOVIES 3.  Use whichever you prefer.  The first view is all about showing the graphics and contains little information.  Movies 2 includes much more detailed movie info at the loss of some graphics, and movies 3 is a combined view that really is the best of both worlds. 

IMPORTANT USING MOVIES 3!  This view isn't obvious at first.  When using the view, you will see a long list of movies on the left and a larget movie poster of the selected movie on the right.  If you navigate to the RIGHT you can access the scrollbar to page throgh movies faster.  If you navigate RIGHT AGAIN, the movie poster will slide over covering the list of movies, and reveal detailed information about the movie you had selected.

720p NOTE: Due to the larger resolution and available screenspace in 720p, there is currently only one movie view, as it is able to present all the information neccesary.

Xephyr (AEON) Backpacks:
Fusion was very much inspired by the Xephyr skin, now known as Aeon, and was designed to be able to use the backpacks from that skin on the home screen.  Currently this is hardcoded, but I will be adding some customization in a later build.  For now, if you wish to use them they must be located in the skin's MEDIA folder, and must be in folders named bg_movies, bg_tvshows, bg_pictures, bg_games, and bg_music.

Anything not skinned SHOULD fall back to PM3, however there are some odd places where even though I haven't touched the file/image, the fallback is buggy.  

Known Issues
------------
If you enter the Video Library, but have nothing in the library (Library NOT file mode), then you may be unable to access the menu.  This skin is really designed to be used in Library mode, but this will be fixed at some point.  In the meantime if this happens to you, pressing LEFT TWICE _should_ get you to the menu where you can change to file mode.  No promise though, and the file mode is not skinned properly yet.
