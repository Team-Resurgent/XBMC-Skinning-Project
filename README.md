## Historical Context

XBMC (Xbox Media Center) began as a media player application for the first-generation Xbox console. The skinning system allowed users to completely customize the look and feel of their media center interface. This repository preserves these skins as a snapshot of media center UI design from that era.

Many of these skins later influenced the design of modern Kodi skins and other media center applications.

## Authors

This collection represents work from numerous contributors to the XBMC community. See `authors.txt` for a mapping of contributors from the original SourceForge repository.

## Usage

> **Note:** These skins were designed for older versions of XBMC and may not be compatible with modern versions of Kodi without modification.

To explore a skin's structure:

1. Navigate to the skin directory
2. Review the `skin.xml` file for metadata
3. Examine XML files for window layouts
4. Browse the `media` folder for graphical assets

Licensing varies by skin. Please check individual skin directories for specific license information. This repository is maintained for historical and educational purposes.

## Contributing

This is primarily a historical archive. If you have additional XBMC skins from this era that are not included, or corrections to existing skins, contributions are welcome.

## Compatibility

These skins are preserved in their original state and are compatible with:
- XBMC versions from the mid-2000s to early 2010s
- Various XBMC codenames: Dharma, Eden, Frodo, Gotham, Helix, Isengard, Jarvis

Modern Kodi versions use a different skinning engine and these skins would require significant modifications to work with current releases.
