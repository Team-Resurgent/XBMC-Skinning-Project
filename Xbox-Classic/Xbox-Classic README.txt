Xbox-Classic Skin for Xbox Media Center 2.0 
Authors Jezz_X and Blackbolt

As of from commit 462 to the SVN this skin has been renamed to 
Xbox-Classic mostly to reflect the change in the main developer 
of the skin me (Jezz_X).  Blackbolt id still the original Author
of 85% of the graphics in the skin but all XML codedinh has been
taken over by me.

History
This skin was originally made by Blackbolt with the name (Blackbolt Classic)
for version 1.0 of XBMC and by me also with the name (Blackbolt Classic) 
and has been completely redone by me (Jezz_X) to make it compatible
with version 2.1 of the XBMC skin engine

Included are the 2 other color themes that were originally shipped
as separate skins they are MOONLIGHT (Blue) and FARENHEIT (Red) the
default color is GREEN.

If you use the two included themes you will need to change the text
color to match the theme this can be done in
Settings \ skin settings \ Change Font Colors to Match skin Theme

All extra strings that need translation (if you wish to) are found
in the Translate.xml in the PAL Directory of the skin the rest
should translate with XBMC Language files (if they are up to date)

Hope you like the remake have fun with it and please report any 
errors you find in it to me on xbox-scene forum in this section
