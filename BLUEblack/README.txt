WABID README -------------------------------
Hey all,

I started this skin as a way of changing BlackBLue by Leonardo, and never dreamed of releasing it.  
But sometime into version 1.0 i realized that i was putting alot of work into this skin, and sombody else may want to use it.  
Thank you Leonardo for letting me mod your skin.  This will hopefully be merged with blackblue very soon, hopefully.

this has been tested with April 30th build, and all is well.  
There may be problems with this skin in pal view, widescreen should be file.
